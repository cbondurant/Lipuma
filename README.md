# lipuma Rust

This is a rewrite of my project [lipuma](https://git.sr.ht/~cbondurant/Lipuma) in the rust programming language.
I have taken this project on in order to improve my programming skills in Rust, as well as to get away from my
frustrations with writing C++ code, and a desire to improve my Rust more and more.

For now if you have a desire to use lipuma, the original C++ project is in a far more complete state and I would
recommend you use it for the time being.

Thank you!
